# Cybridge AI: Next-Gen Cybersecurity Platform

## Overview

**Cybridge AI** is an advanced, full-stack cybersecurity platform built to secure small and medium enterprises (SMEs), empower youth through cyber education, and showcase cutting-edge machine learning (ML) integration, all aligned with UN SDG #9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Threat Detection Dashboard:**  
  Instantly visualize and monitor potential cyber threats using live ML-driven analytics, interactive dashboards, and a global threat map.
- **Youth Training Portal:**  
  A gamified and adaptive learning platform for young users, leveraging reinforcement and self-supervised learning for skill assessment, custom learning paths, and competitive leaderboards.
- **SME Analytics:**  
  Comprehensive risk scoring, vulnerability assessment, and compliance tracking powered by ML models.
- **ML Pipeline Visualization:**  
  See all 5 learning paradigms (Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised, Self-Supervised, and Reinforcement Learning) in action, with context-aware performance metrics.
- **World-Class Responsive UI:**  
  Fully responsive design works beautifully on mobile phones and laptops, with an intuitive navigation experience.
- **About Page:**  
  Learn more about the project, its goals, and how it empowers both SMEs and youth. Accessible via the navigation menu or at `/about`.

## Machine Learning Paradigms

| Paradigm             | Use Case                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Supervised           | Classifying phishing/malware threats in real time |
| Unsupervised         | Anomaly detection in network/user activity        |
| Semi-Supervised      | Skill assessments, improving predictions with limited labels |
| Self-Supervised      | User/device behavior modeling                     |
| Reinforcement        | Adaptive SME protection, youth learning guidance  |
